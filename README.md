# EasyPark

An android application which helps people in finding the nearest vacant parking spot. 
This app takes the current location of the user and lists the near by  vacant parking lots. 
The user can choose the best parking spot and buy the parking ticket if the parking is not free.
The user can then mark the parking spot and keep reminder if the parking time is about to expire, thereby allowing the 
users to  find where they parked the car or  renew the ticket if it is about to expire.
